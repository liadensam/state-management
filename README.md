# State Management âœ…

For this project I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpdFj8MEuJA&ab_channel=JackHerrington). It is a walkthrough of different ways how to manage state in React. We want to avoid [prop-drilling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-prop-drilling-and-how-to-avoid-it/). It covers useState, useReducer, Context and other third party solutions such as [zustand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zustand) and [context-selector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/context-selector).

Each solution is placed in its folder in the code structure, either `counter` or `ecommerce`. The usage is demonstrated with a counter, cart or login and logout functions.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

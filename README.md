# State Management

For this project I went through [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpdFj8MEuJA&ab_channel=JackHerrington), that shows many ways to manage state, by using useState, useReducer, Context and other third party solutions. Each solution has its own page that is either in the folder "counter" or "ecommerce", showing the use of state with a counter or cart and a login/logout function.

The third party solutions used are:
- [zustand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zustand)
- [context-selector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/context-selector)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
